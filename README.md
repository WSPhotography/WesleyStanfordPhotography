# Photographer Portfolio — "Inspired" Template

**Important:** This project is an original site *inspired by* the clean, image-forward look of many photographer portfolio sites. It is NOT a copy of any existing site's code, assets, or exact layout.

## What is included
- `index.html` — single-page responsive site
- `styles.css` — hand-written CSS
- `script.js` — small JS for a lightbox and dynamic year
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
3. Replace the placeholder images with your own images (they're currently hotlinked from Unsplash).
4. Update text, colors, and fonts in `styles.css`.

## Customization ideas
- Replace hotlinked images with local files in an `assets/` folder.
- Add an admin CMS or Netlify/Vercel deploy pipeline.
- Swap fonts or tune spacing to match your brand.
