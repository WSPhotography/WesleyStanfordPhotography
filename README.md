# Photographer Portfolio — Inspired Template v2 (Mixed style)

**Important:** This is an original design inspired by the aesthetic you requested. It intentionally does NOT copy or reuse any proprietary code, assets or unique structural elements from another site.

## Contents
- `index.html` — single page with fullscreen hero, portfolio grid, and journal section
- `styles.css` — refined responsive styles with editorial typographic choices
- `script.js` — viewer/lightbox functionality + smooth scrolling
- `README.md` — this document

## How to use
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages (ensure `index.html` is at the repo root).
3. Replace hotlinked Unsplash images with your own images or add an `assets/` folder and update the `src` and `data-full` attributes to point to local files.
4. Tweak fonts, spacing or colours in `styles.css` to suit your branding.

## Notes
- The gallery viewer supports keyboard navigation (Esc, left/right arrows).
- For best visual results, use high-resolution images for `data-full` (2000px+ width) and compressed thumbnails for grid items.

If you want I can:
- Replace images with local assets from a folder you provide.
- Convert this to a multi-page design with an archive and individual project pages.
- Add pagination, tagging, or CMS integration (NetlifyCMS, Sanity, Contentful).
